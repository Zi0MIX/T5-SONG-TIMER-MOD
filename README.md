# A patch with automated timers for accurate timing of song speedruns.

### Timing rules
- Start position: When screen fades in </br>
- Finish position: Immidiately after all conditions required for playing the music are met </br>

### Details
- Mod should work on Plutonium, however it has not been tested or verified for it, it's meant for Steam version. </br>
- Patch will support all BO1 Song Easter Eggs (WIP) </br>
- Patch does not change any game rules besides setting Strafe & Backspeed to proper values. </br>
- If you want to report a problem or request a feature, you may use the Issues section. </br>
- [GameMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod/releases/tag/v1.3.2) is **required** for this mod to work. Simply put most recent release in `Mods` folder inside your BO1 folder. Please reffer to [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=black+ops+1+%22gamemod%22+installation) if you do not know how to install GameMod to your BO1. No it won't get you banned and it won't screw your game in any way.

### Features
- Auto splits for songs. 
    - Accuracy up to one decimal point (exception for Nacht radio, accuracy is up to .05 seconds. Any lower number realistically doesn't matter as the script for checking for song activation runs at that clock.)
- Built-in timer (seconds) showing on the screen at all times.
- Back / Strafe speed fix
- Attempt counter
- Song lock displayer
- Velocity meter & Gspeed displayer

### Plans
